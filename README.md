# R is for Actuaries
An introductory R course designed for actuaries.

## Week 1: DATA MANIPULATION WITH DPLYR
* Calculate actual to expected mortality experience by various cohorts.
* Learn common tasks such as: group by, sum, filter rows, select columns, calculate new variables, join tables

## WEEK 2: DATA VISUALIZATION WITH GGPLOT2 AND PLOTLY
* Visualize the summaries created in week 1.
* Create visualizations for categorical variables, numerical variables, and combinations.
* Use plotly to add tool tips on hover and introduce interactivity.
* Use aesthetics and faceting to effectively visualize numerous dimensions in a single chart.

## WEEK 3: PROJECT DOCUMENTATION WITH R MARKDOWN
* Without leaving R - create management ready document summarizing results of our work from weeks 1 and 2.
* Can export document to HTML, PDF, Word, and more.
* Ability to add code snippets and interactive visualizations.

## WEEK 4: BUILDING A DASHBOARD WITH SHINY
* Add interactivity to plots created in week 2.
* Publish dashboard along with document created in week 3.
* Can potentially make it all available to management via a url - they don't even need to know how to spell R.

Each week builds on the previous week.  Your homework from week 1 will be used for our visualizations in week 2, etc. I will include the following each week:
* HTML summary of the week's lecture (created in RMarkdown).
* Video recording that walks you through the HTML file and demonstrates all the steps in R.
* R script which is the result of following along with the coding during that week's lecture.
* Any necessary data.
* Sample solution from the  previous week's homework.
